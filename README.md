👋 Hi, I’m Nitya (@nitya70)!
🌟 Welcome to my little corner of the coding universe.

    👀 I’m interested in all things AI, ML, and cool tech innovations.
    🌱 I’m currently learning how to make machines smarter (and maybe a bit more human-like).
    💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on fun AI/ML projects or anything creative and techy!
    📫 How to reach me: lankanitya2005@gmail.com (or just ping me here!)
    😄 Pronouns: She/Her
    ⚡ Fun fact: My favorite debugging technique is bribing my code with snacks—it works 1% of the time, every time! 🐱‍💻🍕
🚀 Let’s innovate, learn, and build something amazing together! 🌈
